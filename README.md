# Scientific Software Design
The goal of this project is to show how modern parctices of Software Development can be applied to Scientific Simulation Code.

The example is an FDTD solver for Electromagnetic Simulation.

The folloing parctices will be followed:
- TDD
- CI/CD

The langauge chosen is C++.
